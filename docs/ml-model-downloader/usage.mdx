title: Firebase ML Model Downloader
sidebar_label: Usage
---

Once installed, you can access the [`firebase_ml_model_downloader`](!firebase_ml_model_downloader) plugin by importing it in your Dart code:

```dart
import 'package:firebase_ml_model_downloader/firebase_ml_model_downloader.dart';
```

Before using the package, you must first have ensured you have [initialized FlutterFire](../overview.mdx#initializing-flutterfire).

To create a new downloader instance, call the [`instance`](!firebase_ml_model_downloader.FirebaseModelDownloader.instance) getter on [`FirebaseModelDownloader`](!firebase_ml_model_downloader.FirebaseModelDownloader):

```dart
FirebaseModelDownloader downloader = FirebaseModelDownloader.instance;
```

By default, this allows you to interact with the downloader using the default Firebase App used whilst installing FlutterFire on your
platform. If however you'd like to use a secondary Firebase App, use the [`instanceFor`](!firebase_ml_model_downloader.FirebaseModelDownloader.instanceFor) method:

```dart
FirebaseApp secondaryApp = Firebase.app('SecondaryApp');
FirebaseModelDownloader downloader = FirebaseModelDownloader.instanceFor(app: secondaryApp);
```

## List downloaded models

To access any locally downloaded models on the device, call the `listDownloadedModels` method. The response contains a list of any locally
downloaded custom models:

```dart
List<FirebaseCustomModel> models = await FirebaseModelDownloader.instance.listDownloadedModels();
```

## Custom model

A custom model contains information such as the name, size and unique hash of the model. It also contains access to the local `File` on the device,
allowing you to provide it to an interpreter plugin.

Once a custom model has been downloaded, you can access it using the [`FirebaseCustomModel`](!firebase_ml_model_downloader.FirebaseCustomModel) class:

```dart
List<FirebaseCustomModel> models = await FirebaseModelDownloader.instance.listDownloadedModels();

models.forEach((model) {
  print('Name: ${model.name}');
  print('Size: ${model.size}');
  print('Hash: ${model.hash}');
});
```

If you're working with a 3rd party interpreter such as [`tflite_flutter`](https://pub.dev/packages/tflite_flutter),
use the returned file to access the model:

```dart
final interpreter = await tfl.Interpreter.fromAsset(
  model.absolute
);
```

## Downloading a model

Once you have [deployed a TensorFlow model](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ml/manage-hosted-models), you can download them to your
device using the `getModel` method, specifying the model name and download options.

```dart
FirebaseCustomModel model = await FirebaseModelDownloader.instance.getModel('myModel', FirebaseModelDownloadType.latestModel);
```

The above code will download the latest available `myModel` model to the device, since the `FirebaseModelDownloadType.latestModel` has been specified.
The method accepts 3 download types for differing behavior:

| Type                                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `FirebaseModelDownloadType.localModel`                   | Returns the current model if present, otherwise triggers new download (or finds one in progress) and only completes when download is finished.                                                                                      |
| `FirebaseModelDownloadType.localModelUpdateInBackground` | Returns the current model if present and triggers an update to fetch a new version in the background. If no local model is present triggers a new download (or finds one in progress) and only completes when download is finished. |
| `FirebaseModelDownloadType.latestModel`                  | Returns the latest model. Checks if latest model is different from local model. If the models are the same, returns the current model. Otherwise, triggers a new model download and returns when this download finishes.            |

You can also provide specific conditions for the download, such as whether the model should be downloaded whilst the device has access to
cellular data, or if the device is charging.

To provide conditions, provide a `FirebaseModelDownloadConditions` instance to the `getModel` method:

```dart
// The following are the default conditions:
FirebaseModelDownloadConditions conditions = FirebaseModelDownloadConditions(
  // Download whilst connected to cellular data
  iosAllowsCellularAccess: true,
  // Allow downloading in the background
  iosAllowsBackgroundDownloading: false,
  // Only download whilst charging
  androidChargingRequired: false,
  // Only download whilst on Wifi
  androidWifiRequired: false,
  // Only download whilst the device is idle
  androidDeviceIdleRequired: false,
);

FirebaseCustomModel model = await FirebaseModelDownloader.instance.getModel('myModel', FirebaseModelDownloadType.latestModel, conditions);
```

## Deleting a download model

To delete a model from the device, call the `deleteDownloadedModel` method:

```dart
await FirebaseModelDownloader.instance.deleteDownloadedModel('myModel');
```

Note; this does not delete the model from your Firebase project, only the local copy on the device. You can download it again at any time.
