The FlutterFire CLI is a useful tool which provides commands to help ease the installation process
of FlutterFire across all supported platforms.

## Installation

The CLI depends on the underlying Firebase CLI. If you haven't done so already, ensure the
[Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli) is installed on your machine.

Next, install the FlutterFire CLI by running the following command:

```bash
dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
```

Once installed, the `flutterfire` command will be globally available.

## Usage

### Generating Firebase Options

FlutterFire can now be initialized from Dart on all platforms using `Firebase.initializeApp`, however
the options for different platforms can vary. The CLI can help, by generating a file
(by default called `firebase_options.dart`) which can be used when calling the initialization method.

The CLI extracts information from your Firebase project and selected project applications to generate
all the configuration for a specific platform.

In the root of your application, run the `configure` command:

```bash
flutterfire configure
```

The configuration command will guide you through a number of processes:

1. Selecting a Firebase project (based on the `.firebaserc` file or from the Firebase Console).
1. Prompt what platforms (e.g. Android, iOS, macOS & web) you would like configuration for.
1. Identify which Firebase applications for the chosen platforms should be used to extract configuration for. By default, the CLI will attempt to automatically match Firebase apps based on your current project configuration.
1. Generate a `firebase_options.dart` file in your project.

Once complete, you can now import the generated file and provide it to the `initializeApp` method:

```dart title="lib/main.dart"
// Import the generated file
import 'firebase_options.dart';
```

Then, provide the current platform options via the `currentPlatform` getter from the `DefaultFirebaseOptions`
class:

```dart
await Firebase.initializeApp(
  options: DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform,
);
```

## Commands

### Configure

Generates a `firebase_options.dart` file which can be provided to the `options` parameter when
[Initializing Firebase](./overview#initialization).

```bash
flutterfire configure
```

The command supports the following option arguments:

| Argument          | Alias | Description                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| --project         | -p    | Sets the Firebase Project ID to use. By default, the CLI will attempt to fetch the project defined in the `.firebaserc` file, or prompt you to select the project from the Firebase Console.    |
| --account         | -e    | Sets the email address which should be used to authenticate with Firebase against. By default, this will use the primary account defined on the Firebase CLI.                                   |
| --out             | -o    | Specifies the path & file name for the generated file. Defaults to "lib/firebase_options.dart".                                                                                                 |
| --ios-bundle-id   | -i    | The bundle identifier of your iOS app, e.g. "com.example.app". If no identifier is provided then an attempt will be made to automatically detect it from your "ios" folder (if it exists).      |
| --macos-bundle-id | -m    | The bundle identifier of your macOS app, e.g. "com.example.app". If no identifier is provided then an attempt will be made to automatically detect it from your "macos" folder (if it exists).  |
| --android-app-id  | -a    | The application id of your Android app, e.g. "com.example.app". If no identifier is provided then an attempt will be made to automatically detect it from your "android" folder (if it exists). |
