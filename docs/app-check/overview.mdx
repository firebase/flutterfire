FlutterFire App Check is an early access preview plugin; APIs may change in a future release.

## What does it do?

App Check helps protect your backend resources (such as Cloud Storage) from
abuse (such as billing fraud or phishing).

With App Check, devices running your app will use an app identity attestation
provider to certify it is indeed your authentic app, and may also check that it's
running on an authentic, untampered device. This certification is attached to every
request your app makes to your Firebase backend resources.

App Check currently supports Cloud Storage, Realtime Database, and Cloud
Functions, with more Firebase products coming soon.

Note: App Check may not protect against certain abuse vectors when paired
with a CDN.
