title: iOS Installation

Before using FlutterFire on iOS, you must first connect to your Firebase project with your iOS application.

## Generating iOS credentials

On the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/overview), add a new iOS app or select an
existing iOS app for your Firebase project. The "iOS bundle ID" must match your local project bundle ID. The ID
can be found within the "General" tab when opening the project with Xcode.

Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file for the Firebase app.

Next you must add the file to the project using XCode (adding manually via the filesystem won't link the file to the
project). Using XCode, open the project's `ios/{projectName}.xcworkspace` file. Right click the project name within XCode
and select "Add files", as seen below:

Select the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file you downloaded, and ensure the "Copy items if needed" checkbox is enabled:

## Configure Firebase with iOS

To allow Firebase on iOS to use the credentials, the Firebase iOS SDK must be configured during the bootstrap phase of your application.

To do this, open the `ios/{projectName}/AppDelegate.m` file and add the following:

1. At the top of the file, import the Firebase SDK:

```objectivec title="ios/{projectName}/AppDelegate.m"
#import <Firebase.h>
```

2. Within the existing didFinishLaunchingWithOptions method, add the following to the top of the method:

```objectivec {3-5} title="ios/{projectName}/AppDelegate.m"
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {

  if ([FIRApp defaultApp] == nil) {
    [FIRApp configure];
  }

  // existing code below...
}
```

## Initializing FlutterFire

Once complete follow the instructions on [Initializing FlutterFire](../overview.mdx#initializing-flutterfire).
