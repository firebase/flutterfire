Welcome to FlutterFire! 🔥

FlutterFire is a set of Flutter plugins which connect your Flutter application to [Firebase](https://firebase.com).

> FlutterFire is currently a work in progress as we work towards a stable release. Plugins & documentation may be incomplete
> or missing functionality. See the [roadmap issue](https://github.com/FirebaseExtended/flutterfire/issues/2582) to learn more.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, the documentation assumes you are able to create (or have an existing) Flutter project and also
have an active Firebase project. If you do not meet these prerequisites, follow the links below:

- [Getting Started with Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
- [Create a new Firebase project](https://console.firebase.google.com/).

## Installation

:::caution
Are you migrating your existing project to these new plugins? Please start with the <a href="https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/migration"><b>migration guide</b></a>.
:::

Before any Firebase services can be used, you must first install the [`firebase_core`](https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_core)
plugin, which is responsible for connecting your application to Firebase. Add the plugin to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

<Tabs
  groupId="legacy-or-nullsafe"
  defaultValue="legacy"
  values={[
    { label: "Legacy", value: "legacy" },
    { label: "Null safety", value: "null-safe" },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="legacy">

```yaml {4} title="pubspec.yaml"
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  firebase_core: "{{ plugins.firebase_core }}"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="null-safe">

```yaml {4} title="pubspec.yaml"
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  firebase_core: "^{{ plugins.firebase_core_ns }}"
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Install the plugin by running the following command from the project root:

```bash
$ flutter pub get
```

## Platform Setup

Once installed, Firebase needs to be configured to work with the various platforms you're working with:

1. [Android Installation](installation/android.mdx).
1. [iOS Installation](installation/ios.mdx).
1. [MacOS Installation](installation/macos.mdx).
1. [Web Installation](installation/web.mdx).

## Initializing FlutterFire

Before any of the Firebase services can be used, FlutterFire needs to be initialized (you can think of this process as
FlutterFire "bootstrapping" itself). The initialization step is asynchronous, meaning you'll need to prevent any FlutterFire
related usage until the initialization is completed.

To initialize FlutterFire, call the [`initializeApp`](!firebase_core.Firebase.initializeApp) method on the [`Firebase`](!firebase_core.Firebase) class:

```dart
await Firebase.initializeApp();
```

The method is asynchronous and returns a [`Future`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-async/Future-class.html), so
you need to ensure it has completed before displaying your main application. The examples below show how this can be
achieved with a [`FutureBuilder`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/FutureBuilder-class.html) or
a [`StatefulWidget`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StatefulWidget-class.html):

<Tabs
  defaultValue="future"
  values={[
    { label: 'FutureBuilder', value: 'future', },
    { label: 'StatefulWidget', value: 'state', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="future">

```dart title="lib/main.dart"
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

// Import the firebase_core plugin
import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart';

void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  runApp(App());
}

class App extends StatelessWidget {
  // Create the initialization Future outside of `build`:
  final Future<FirebaseApp> _initialization = Firebase.initializeApp();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return FutureBuilder(
      // Initialize FlutterFire:
      future: _initialization,
      builder: (context, snapshot) {
        // Check for errors
        if (snapshot.hasError) {
          return SomethingWentWrong();
        }

        // Once complete, show your application
        if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.done) {
          return MyAwesomeApp();
        }

        // Otherwise, show something whilst waiting for initialization to complete
        return Loading();
      },
    );
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="state">

```dart title="lib/main.dart"
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

// Import the firebase_core plugin
import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart';

void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  runApp(App());
}

class App extends StatefulWidget {
  _AppState createState() => _AppState();
}

class _AppState extends State<App> {
  // Set default `_initialized` and `_error` state to false
  bool _initialized = false;
  bool _error = false;

  // Define an async function to initialize FlutterFire
  void initializeFlutterFire() async {
    try {
      // Wait for Firebase to initialize and set `_initialized` state to true
      await Firebase.initializeApp();
      setState(() {
        _initialized = true;
      });
    } catch(e) {
      // Set `_error` state to true if Firebase initialization fails
      setState(() {
        _error = true;
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  void initState() {
    initializeFlutterFire();
    super.initState();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Show error message if initialization failed
    if(_error) {
      return SomethingWentWrong();
    }

    // Show a loader until FlutterFire is initialized
    if (!_initialized) {
      return Loading();
    }

    return MyAwesomeApp();
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once initialized, you're ready to get started using FlutterFire!

## Improve iOS Build Times

Currently the Firestore iOS SDK depends on some 500k lines of mostly C++ code which can take upwards of 5 minutes to build in XCode. To reduce build times significantly, you can use a pre-compiled version by adding 1 line to your `ios/Podfile` inside your Flutter project;

`pod 'FirebaseFirestore', :git => 'https://github.com/invertase/firestore-ios-sdk-frameworks.git', :tag => '6.26.0'`

Add this line inside your target 'Runner' do block in your Podfile, e.g.:

```
# ...
target 'Runner' do
  pod 'FirebaseFirestore', :git => 'https://github.com/invertase/firestore-ios-sdk-frameworks.git', :tag => '6.26.0'
# ...
end
```

Additionally, ensure that you have upgraded your cocoapods to 1.9.1 or higher:
`gem install cocoapods`

For more information see this issue: https://github.com/FirebaseExtended/flutterfire/issues/2751

## Overriding Native SDK Versions

FlutterFire internally sets the versions of the native SDKs that each module uses. Each release is tested against a fixed
set of SDK version to ensure everything works as expected.

If you wish to change these versions, you can manually override the native SDK versions

### Android

In the `/android/app/build.gradle` file, you can provide your own versions using the options shown below:

```groovy
rootProject.ext {
  set('FlutterFire', [
    FirebaseSDKVersion: '25.12.0'
  ])
}
```

### iOS/MacOS

Open your `/ios/Podfile` or `/macos/Podfile` file and add any of the globals below to the top of the file:

```ruby
# Override Firebase SDK Version
$FirebaseSDKVersion = '6.33.0'
```

## Next Steps

On its own the [`firebase_core`](!firebase_core) plugin provides basic functionality for usage with Firebase. FlutterFire is broken down
into several individual installable plugins that allow you to integrate with a specific Firebase service.

The table below lists all of the currently supported plugins. You can follow the documentation for each plugin to
get started:
