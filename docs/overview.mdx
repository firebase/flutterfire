Welcome to FlutterFire! 🔥

FlutterFire is a set of Flutter plugins which connect your Flutter application to [Firebase](https://firebase.com).

## Get to know Firebase for Flutter

If you're new to using Firebase in Flutter we recommend starting with the
[Get to know Firebase for Flutter codelab](https://firebase.google.com/codelabs/firebase-get-to-know-flutter) and video:

<YouTube id="wUSkeTaBonA" />

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, the documentation assumes you are able to create (or have an existing) Flutter project and also
have an active Firebase account.

- [Getting Started with Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

## Installation

:::caution
Are you migrating your existing project to these new plugins? Please start with the <a href="https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/migration"><b>migration guide</b></a>.
:::

Before any Firebase services can be used, you must first install the [`firebase_core`](https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_core)
plugin, which is responsible for connecting your application to Firebase.

Install the plugin by running the following command from the project root:

```bash
flutter pub add firebase_core
```

## Initializing FlutterFire

⚡ **️FlutterFire now supports initialization directly from Dart!** ⚡️

Before any of the Firebase services can be used, FlutterFire needs to be initialized (you can think of this process as
FlutterFire "bootstrapping" itself). The initialization step is asynchronous, meaning you'll need to prevent any FlutterFire
related usage until the initialization is completed.

:::tip

If you're using FlutterFire in an existing application, you can use Dart-only initialization for most plugins.
However, there are plugins that still require [manual-installation](./manual-installation.mdx) (i.e. using `google-services.json` or `GoogleService-Info.plist` files).
Please see this [usage guide](./cli.mdx#usage) to learn what plugins need manual installation.

### Using the FlutterFire CLI

:::info

The FlutterFire CLI depends on the [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli).  If you haven't installed it yet, you can learn more about Firebase CLI in the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli).

:::

To initialize FlutterFire, call the [`initializeApp`](!firebase_core.Firebase.initializeApp) method on the [`Firebase`](!firebase_core.Firebase) class.
The method accepts your Firebase project application configuration, which can be obtained for all supported platforms by using the FlutterFire CLI:

```bash
# Install the CLI if not already done so
dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli

# Run the `configure` command, select a Firebase project and platforms
flutterfire configure
```

Once configured, a `firebase_options.dart` file will be generated for you containing all the options
required for initialization.

**Learn more about the FlutterFire CLI in the [documentation](./cli.mdx)**.

### Initialization

Next the generated options need to be provided to the [`initializeApp`](!firebase_core.Firebase.initializeApp) method.
Since this is an asynchronous operation, the `main` function can be modified to ensure initialization is complete before
running the application.

First import the `firebase_core` plugin and generated `firebase_options.dart` file:

```dart title="lib/main.dart"
import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart';
import 'firebase_options.dart';
```

Next, within the `main` function, ensure `WidgetsFlutterBinding` is initialized and then initialize Firebase:

```dart title="lib/main.dart"
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await Firebase.initializeApp(
    options: DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform,
  );
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

The `DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform` are imported from our generated `firebase_options.dart` file.

Once initialized, you're ready to get started using FlutterFire!

## Manual Installation

With Dart-only initialization now supported, manually configuring and installing platforms is no longer
required. If you wish to view the documentation for manual initialization, view the
[Manual Installation](./manual-installation.mdx) documentation.

## Next Steps

On its own the [`firebase_core`](!firebase_core) plugin provides basic functionality for usage with Firebase. FlutterFire is broken down
into several individual installable plugins that allow you to integrate with a specific Firebase service.

See the documentation for each plugin to learn more about them.
