##  What does it do?

Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) is a cross-platform messaging solution that lets you reliably send messages at no cost.

Using FCM, you can notify a client app that new email or other data is available to sync. You can send notification
messages to drive user re-engagement and retention. For use cases such as instant messaging, a message can transfer
a payload of up to 4KB to a client app.

  firebase_messaging: "^{{ plugins.firebase_messaging }}"
```

### 2. Download dependency

### 3. iOS Integration

iOS requires additional configuration before you can start receiving messages through Firebase. Read the integration documentation on how to [setup iOS with Firebase Cloud Messaging](messaging/ios-integration.mdx).

### 4. (Web Only) Add the SDK

> Web is currently not supported. See the [FlutterFire roadmap](https://github.com/FirebaseExtended/flutterfire/issues/2582).

### 5. Rebuild your app

Once complete, rebuild your Flutter application:

```bash
$ flutter run
```

## Next Steps

Once installed, you're ready to start using Firebase Cloud Messaging in your Flutter Project.

> Additional documentation will be available once the Firebase Cloud Messaging plugin update lands as part of the [FlutterFire roadmap](https://github.com/FirebaseExtended/flutterfire/issues/2582).
