## What does it do?

Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) is a cross-platform messaging solution that lets you reliably send messages at no cost.

Using FCM, you can notify a client app that new email or other data is available to sync. You can send notification
messages to drive user re-engagement and retention. For use cases such as instant messaging, a message can transfer
a payload of up to 4KB to a client app.

## Installation

### 1. Add dependency

```yaml {5} title="pubspec.yaml"
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  firebase_core: "^{{ plugins.firebase_core }}"
  firebase_messaging: "^{{ plugins.firebase_messaging }}"
```

### 2. Download dependency

```
$ flutter pub get
```

### 3. Android Integration

> If you are using Flutter Android Embedding V2 (Flutter Version >= 1.12) then no additional integration steps are required for Android.

#### Flutter Android Embedding V1

For the Flutter Android Embedding V1, the background service must be provided a callback to register plugins with the
background isolate. This is done by giving the `FlutterFirebaseMessagingBackgroundService` a callback to call your
application's `onCreate` method.

In particular, its `Application` class:

```java {2,9}
// ...
import io.flutter.plugins.firebase.messaging.FlutterFirebaseMessagingBackgroundService;

public class Application extends FlutterApplication implements PluginRegistrantCallback {
  // ...
  @Override
  public void onCreate() {
    super.onCreate();
    FlutterFirebaseMessagingBackgroundService.setPluginRegistrant(this);
  }

  @Override
  public void registerWith(PluginRegistry registry) {
    GeneratedPluginRegistrant.registerWith(registry);
  }
  // ...
}
```

Which is usually reflected in the application's `AndroidManifest.xml`. E.g.:

```xml {2}
    <application
        android:name=".Application"
        ...
```

> **Note:** Not calling `FlutterFirebaseMessagingBackgroundService.setPluginRegistrant` will result in an exception being
thrown when a message eventually comes through.

### 4. Apple Integration

iOS & macOS require additional configuration before you can start receiving messages through Firebase.
Read the integration documentation on how to [setup iOS or macOS with Firebase Cloud Messaging](messaging/apple-integration.mdx).

### 5. (Web Only) Add the SDK

> Web is currently not supported. See the [FlutterFire roadmap](https://github.com/FirebaseExtended/flutterfire/issues/2582).

### 6. Rebuild your app

Once complete, rebuild your Flutter application:

```bash
$ flutter run
```

## Next Steps

Once installed, you're ready to start using Firebase Cloud Messaging in your Flutter Project.

View the [Usage documentation](usage.mdx) to get started.
