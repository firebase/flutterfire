## What does it do?

Firestore is a flexible, scalable NoSQL cloud database to store and sync data.
It keeps your data in sync across client apps through realtime listeners and offers offline support so you can build responsive apps that work regardless of network latency or Internet connectivity.

## Installation

### 1. Make sure to initialize Firebase

[Follow this guide](../overview.mdx) to install `firebase_core` and initialize Firebase if you haven't already.

### 2. Add dependency

On the root of your Flutter project, run the following command to install the plugin:

```bash {5}
flutter pub add cloud_firestore
```

### 3. Rebuild your app

Once complete, rebuild your Flutter application:

```bash
flutter run
```

### 4. (optional) Improve iOS & macOS build times

Currently, the Firestore iOS SDK depends on some 500k lines of mostly C++ code which can take upwards of 5 minutes to build in Xcode. To reduce build times significantly, you can use a pre-compiled version by adding 1 line to your `ios/Podfile` inside your Flutter project;

`pod 'FirebaseFirestore', :git => 'https://github.com/invertase/firestore-ios-sdk-frameworks.git', :tag => '8.11.0'` 

Add this line inside your target 'Runner' do block in your Podfile, e.g.:

```
# ...
target 'Runner' do
  pod 'FirebaseFirestore', :git => 'https://github.com/invertase/firestore-ios-sdk-frameworks.git', :tag => '8.11.0'
# ...
end
```

Additionally, ensure that you have upgraded your cocoapods to 1.9.1 or higher:
`gem install cocoapods`
