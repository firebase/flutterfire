## What does it do?

Firebase In-App Messaging helps you engage your app's active users by sending them targeted,
contextual messages that encourage them to use key app features. For example, you could send
an in-app message to get users to subscribe, watch a video, complete a level, or buy an item.
You can customize messages as cards, banners, modals, or images, and set up triggers so that
they appear exactly when they'd benefit your users most.
Use Firebase In-App Messaging to encourage exploration and discovery: highlight a sale or
coupon in your ecommerce app, give clues or tips in your game, or prompt a like or share in
your social media app.
