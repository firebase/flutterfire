## What does it do?

Firebase In-App Messaging helps you engage your app's active users by sending them targeted,
contextual messages that encourage them to use key app features. For example, you could send
an in-app message to get users to subscribe, watch a video, complete a level, or buy an item.
You can customize messages as cards, banners, modals, or images, and set up triggers so that
they appear exactly when they'd benefit your users most.
Use Firebase In-App Messaging to encourage exploration and discovery: highlight a sale or
coupon in your ecommerce app, give clues or tips in your game, or prompt a like or share in
your social media app.

## Installation

Before installing the In-App Messaging for Firebase plugin, ensure that you have followed the [Getting Started](../overview.mdx) documentation
and have initialized FlutterFire.

<Tabs
groupId="legacy-or-nullsafe"
defaultValue="legacy"
values={[
    { label: "Legacy", value: "legacy" },
    { label: "Null safety", value: "null-safe" },
]}
>
<TabItem value="legacy">

For legacy package imports, place the following ignore comment to hide Dart analyzer warnings:

```dart
// ignore: import_of_legacy_library_into_null_safe
import 'package:firebase-in-app-messaging/firebase-in-app-messaging.dart';
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="null-safe">

Ensure you're using the Flutter `stable` channel:

```bash
$ flutter channel stable
```

If your app is mixing legacy and null-safe packages, use the `--no-sound-null-safety` flag:

```bash
$ flutter run --no-sound-null-safety
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 1. Add dependency

<Tabs
  groupId="legacy-or-nullsafe"

    { label: "Legacy", value: "legacy" },
    { label: "Null safety", value: "null-safe" },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="legacy">

```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 2. Download dependency
