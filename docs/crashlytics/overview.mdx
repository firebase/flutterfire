## What does it do?

Crashlytics helps you to collect analytics and details about crashes and errors that occur in your app. It does this through three aspects:

- **Logs**: Log events in your app to be sent with the crash report for context if your app crashes.
- **Crash reports**: Every crash is automatically turned into a crash report and sent when the application next opens.
- **Stack traces**: Even when an error is caught and your app recovers, the Dart stack trace can still be sent.

## Installation

### 1. Add dependency

On the root of your Flutter project, run the following command to install the plugin:

```bash {5}
flutter pub add firebase_crashlytics
```

### 2. (optional) Platform integration

Dart-only Firebase initialization currently only supports reporting Dart exceptions. To report native Android & iOS exception
please follow the Android platform Setup section from the [manual installation guide](../manual-installation.mdx) and the steps below.

#### a. Android

1. Add the following classpaths to your `android/build.gradle` file.

```groovy {4} title="android/build.gradle"
dependencies {
  // ... other dependencies
  classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.5'
  classpath 'com.google.firebase:firebase-crashlytics-gradle:2.7.1'
}
```

2. Apply the following to your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

```groovy {13} title="android/app/build.gradle"
// ... other imports

android {
  // ... your android config
}

dependencies {
  // ... your dependencies
}

// This must appear at the bottom of the file
apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
apply plugin: 'com.google.firebase.crashlytics'
```

#### b. iOS

1. From Xcode, select Runner from the project navigation.
2. Select the Build Phases tab, then click + > New Run Script Phase.
3. Add the following to the Type a script... text box underneath the Shell property:

```bash
$PODS_ROOT/FirebaseCrashlytics/upload-symbols --build-phase --validate -ai <googleAppId>
$PODS_ROOT/FirebaseCrashlytics/upload-symbols --build-phase -ai <googleAppId>
```

Retrieve your `<googleAppId>` from your generated `DefaultFirebaseOptions` file (`appId`) or from the Firebase Console -> Project Settings -> Your apps.

### 3. Rebuild your app

Once complete, rebuild your Flutter application:

```bash
flutter run
```

## Next steps

Once installed, you're ready to start using Firebase Crashlytics in your Flutter Project. View the
[Usage documentation](./usage.mdx) to get started.
