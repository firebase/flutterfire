## Getting started

Enable Firebase Crashytlics in the Firebase console.

<Image src="enable-firebase-crashlytics.png" alt="Enable in the console" />

Until an error has been reported, you will see this screen.

<Image src="crashlytics-init.png" alt="Crashytlics init screen" />

To start using Firebase Crashlytics within your project, import it at the top of your project files:

```dart
import 'package:firebase_crashlytics/firebase_crashlytics.dart';
```

Run an example, such as...

```dart
// Initialize Firebase.
await Firebase.initializeApp();

// Elsewhere in your code
FirebaseCrashlytics.instance.crash();
```

This will crash the currently running application. You will then need to manually re-run your application on your emulator for Crashlytics to submit the crash report to the Firebase Console.

## Sending reports to Crashlytics

To send report data to Crashlytics, the **application must be restarted**. Crashlytics automatically sends any crash reports
to Firebase the next time the application is launched.

## Toggle Crashlytics collection

Call the `setCrashlyticsCollectionEnabled` method to toggle Crashlytics collection status.

For example to ensure it is disabled when your app is in debug mode you can do the following:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart' show kDebugMode;

// ...

if (kDebugMode) {
  // Force disable Crashlytics collection while doing every day development.
  // Temporarily toggle this to true if you want to test crash reporting in your app.
  await FirebaseCrashlytics.instance
      .setCrashlyticsCollectionEnabled(false);
} else {
  // Handle Crashlytics enabled status when not in Debug,
  // e.g. allow your users to opt-in to crash reporting.
}
```

You can additionally read the current collection enabled status:

```dart
if (FirebaseCrashlytics.instance.isCrashlyticsCollectionEnabled) {
  // Collection is enabled.
}
```

## Forcing a crash

You don't have to wait for a crash to know that Crashlytics is working. To force a crash, call the `crash` method:

```dart
FirebaseCrashlytics.instance.crash();
```

Your app should exit immediately after calling this method. After opening your app again after the crash
Firebase Crashlytics will upload the crash report to the Firebase Console.

The error will be show on the Firebase Crashlytics dashboard as an instance of `FirebaseCrashlyticsTestCrash`, with a message of
`This is a test crash caused by calling .crash() in Dart.`

## Crash types

### Fatal crash

If you would like to record a fatal error, you may pass in a `fatal` argument as `true`.
The crash report will appear in your Crashlytics dashboard with the event type `Crash`, the event summary stack trace will also be referenced as a `Fatal Exception`.

```dart
await FirebaseCrashlytics.instance.recordError(
  error, 
  stackTrace,
  reason: 'a fatal error',
  // Pass in 'fatal' argument
  fatal: true
);
```

### Non-Fatal crash

By default non-fatal errors are recorded. The crash report will appear in your Crashlytics dashboard with the event type `Non-fatal`, the event summary stack trace will also be referenced as a `Non-fatal Exception`.

```dart
await FirebaseCrashlytics.instance.recordError(
  error, 
  stackTrace,
  reason: 'a non-fatal error'
);
```

## Add custom keys

To associate key/value pairs with your crash reports, you can use the `setCustomKey` method

```dart
// Set a key to a string.
FirebaseCrashlytics.instance.setCustomKey('str_key', 'hello');

// Set a key to a boolean.
FirebaseCrashlytics.instance.setCustomKey("bool_key", true);

// Set a key to an int.
FirebaseCrashlytics.instance.setCustomKey("int_key", 1);

// Set a key to a long.
FirebaseCrashlytics.instance.setCustomKey("int_key", 1L);

// Set a key to a float.
FirebaseCrashlytics.instance.setCustomKey("float_key", 1.0f);

// Set a key to a double.
FirebaseCrashlytics.instance.setCustomKey("double_key", 1.0);
```

> This accepts a maximum of 64 key/value pairs. New keys beyond that limit are ignored. Keys or values that exceed 1024 characters are truncated.

## Add custom log messages

To add custom Crashlytics log messages to your app, use the `log` method

```dart
FirebaseCrashlytics.instance.log("Higgs-Boson detected! Bailing out");
```

## Set user identifiers

To add user IDs to your reports, assign each user with a unique ID. This can be an ID number, token or hashed value:

```dart
FirebaseCrashlytics.instance.setUserIdentifier("12345");
```

## Handling uncaught errors

By overriding `FlutterError.onError` with `FirebaseCrashlytics.instance.recordFlutterError`, it will automatically
catch all errors that are thrown within the Flutter framework.

```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  
  await Firebase.initializeApp();

  // Pass all uncaught errors from the framework to Crashlytics.
  FlutterError.onError = FirebaseCrashlytics.instance.recordFlutterError;

  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

### Zoned Errors

Not all errors are caught by Flutter. Sometimes, errors are instead caught by Zones.  
A common case were `FlutterError` would not be enough is when an exception happen
inside the `onPressed` of a button:

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () {
    throw Error();
  }
  ...
)
```

To catch such errors, you can use `runZonedGuarded` like do:

```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await Firebase.initializeApp();
  runZonedGuarded<Future<void>>(() async {
    // The following lines are the same as previously explained in "Handling uncaught errors"
    FlutterError.onError = FirebaseCrashlytics.instance.recordFlutterError;

    runApp(MyApp());
  }, FirebaseCrashlytics.instance.recordError);
}
```

### Errors outside of Flutter

To catch errors that happen outside of the Flutter context, install an error listener on the current Isolate:

```dart
Isolate.current.addErrorListener(RawReceivePort((pair) async {
  final List<dynamic> errorAndStacktrace = pair;
  await FirebaseCrashlytics.instance.recordError(
    errorAndStacktrace.first,
    errorAndStacktrace.last,
  );
}).sendPort);
```

## Enable opt-in reporting

By default, Crashlytics will automatically collect crash reports for all your app's users. To give users more control over
the data they send, you can enable opt-in reporting by disabling automatic collection and initializing Crashlytics only for selected users:

1. Turn off automatic collection natively:

a. Android
In the `application` block of your `AndroidManifest.xml` file, add a `meta-data` tags to turn off automatic collection:

```xml
<meta-data
  android:name="firebase_crashlytics_collection_enabled"
  android:value="false" />
```

b. iOS

Add a new key to your `Info.plist` file.

- Key: `FirebaseCrashlyticsCollectionEnabled`
- Value: `false`

2. Enable collection for select users by calling the Crashlytics data collection override at runtime. To opt out of automatic
   crash reporting, pass `false` as the override value. When set to `false`, the new value does not apply until the next run
   of the app.

```dart
FirebaseCrashlytics.instance.setCrashlyticsCollectionEnabled(true);
```
