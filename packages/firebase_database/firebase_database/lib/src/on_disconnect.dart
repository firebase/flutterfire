/// The onDisconnect class allows you to write or clear data when your client
/// disconnects from the Database server. These updates occur whether your
/// client disconnects cleanly or not, so you can rely on them to clean up data
/// even if a connection is dropped or a client crashes.
///
/// The onDisconnect class is most commonly used to manage presence in
/// applications where it is useful to detect how many clients are connected
/// and when other clients disconnect.
///
/// To avoid problems when a connection is dropped before the requests can be
/// transferred to the Database server, these functions should be called before
/// writing any data.
///
/// Note that onDisconnect operations are only triggered once. If you want an
/// operation to occur each time a disconnect occurs, you'll need to
/// re-establish the onDisconnect operations each time you reconnect.
