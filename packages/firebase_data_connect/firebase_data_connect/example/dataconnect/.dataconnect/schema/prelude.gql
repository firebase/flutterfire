"""
Timestamp is a RFC 3339 string that represents an exact point in time.

The serialization format follows https://scalars.graphql.org/andimarek/date-time
except the "Non-optional exact milliseconds" Section. As a FDC-specific
extension, inputs and outputs may contain 0, 3, 6, or 9 fractional digits.

Specifically, output precision varies by server-side factors such as data source
support and clients must not rely on an exact number of digits. Clients may
truncate extra digits as fit, with the caveat that there may be information loss
if the truncated value is subsequently sent back to the server.

FDC only supports year 1583 to 9999 (inclusive) and uses the ISO-8601 calendar
system for all date-time calculations. Notably, the expanded year representation
(+/-YYYYY) is rejected and Year 1582 and before may either be rejected or cause
undefined behavior.
