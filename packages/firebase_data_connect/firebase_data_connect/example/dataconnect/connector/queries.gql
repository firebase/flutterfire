# # Example queries for a simple email app.

## @auth() directives control who can call each operation.
## Only admins should be able to list all users, so we use NO_ACCESS
# query ListUsers @auth(level: NO_ACCESS) {
#   users { uid, name, email: address }
# }

## Everyone should be able to see their inbox though, so we use PUBLIC
# query ListInbox(
#   $uid: String
# ) @auth(level: PUBLIC) {
## where allows you to filter lists
## Here, we use it to filter to only emails where this user is one of the recipients.
#   emails(where: {
#     users_via_Recipient: { 
#       exist: { uid: { eq: $uid }
#     }}
#   }) {
#     id subject sent 
#     content: text 
#     sender: from { name email: address uid }

## <field>_on_<foreign_key_field> makes it easy to grab info from another table
## Here, we use it to grab all the recipients of the email.
#     to: recipients_on_email {
#       user { name email: address uid }
#     }
#   }
# }

# query GetUidByEmail($emails: [String!]) @auth(level: PUBLIC) {
