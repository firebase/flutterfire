  summary: |-
    Google Service Management allows service producers to publish their
    services on Google Cloud Platform so that they can be discovered and used
    by service consumers.
  overview: |-
    Google Service Management manages a set of *services*. Service Management
    allows *service producers* to
    publish their services on Google Cloud Platform so that they can be
    discovered and used by *service consumers*. It also handles the tasks of
    tracking
    service lifecycle and programming various backend systems -- such as
    [Stackdriver Logging](https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver),
    [Stackdriver Monitoring](https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver) -- to
    support the managed services.

    If you are a service producer, you can use the Google Service Management
    API and [Google Cloud SDK (gcloud)](https://cloud.google.com/sdk) to
    publish and manage your services. Each managed service has a service
    configuration which declares various aspects of the service such as its
    API surface, along with parameters to configure the supporting
    backend
    systems, such as logging and monitoring. If you build your service using
    [Google Cloud Endpoints](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/), the service
    configuration will be handled automatically.

    If you are a service consumer and want to use a managed service, you can
    use the Google Service Management API or [Google Cloud
    Console](https://console.cloud.google.com) to activate the service for
    your [Google developer
    project](https://developers.google.com/console/help/new/), then start
    using its APIs and functions.

    ## Managed services

    REST URL:
    `https://servicemanagement.googleapis.com/v1/services/{service-name}` <br
    /> REST schema is defined
    [here](https://cloud.google.com/service-management/reference/rest/v1/services). A
    managed service refers to a network service managed by
    Service Management. Each managed service has a unique name, such as
    `example.googleapis.com`, which must be a valid fully-qualified DNS name,
    as per RFC 1035.

    A managed service typically provides some REST APIs and/or other
    functions to their service consumers, such as mobile apps or cloud
    services.

    Service producers can use methods, such as
    [services.create](https://cloud.google.com/service-management/reference/rest/v1/services/create), [services.delete](https://cloud.google.com/service-management/reference/rest/v1/services/delete), [services.undelete](https://cloud.google.com/service-management/reference/rest/v1/services/undelete), to
    manipulate their managed services.

    ## Service producers

    A service producer is the Google developer project responsible for
    publishing and maintaining a managed service. Each managed service is
    owned by exactly one service producer.

    ## Service consumers

    A service consumer is a Google developer project that has enabled and can
    invoke APIs on a managed service. A managed service can have many service
    consumers.

    ## Service configuration

    REST URL:
    `https://servicemanagement.googleapis.com/v1/services/{service-name}/configs/{config_id}`
    <br /> REST schema is defined
    [here](https://cloud.google.com/service-management/reference/rest/v1/services.configs). Each
    managed service is described by a service configuration which covers a
    wide range of features, including its name, title, RPC API
    definitions,
    REST API definitions, documentation, authentication, and more.

    To change the configuration of a managed service, the service producer
    needs to publish an updated service configuration to Service
    Management.
    Service Management keeps a history of published
    service configurations, making it possible to easily retrace how a
    service's configuration evolved over time. Service configurations can be
    published
    using the [services.configs.create](https://cloud.google.com/service-management/reference/rest/v1/services.configs/create) or
    [services.configs.submit](https://cloud.google.com/service-management/reference/rest/v1/services.configs/submit) methods. Alternatively,
    `services.configs.submit` allows publishing an
    [OpenAPI](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) specification,
    formerly known as the Swagger Specification, which is automatically
    converted to a corresponding service configuration.

    ## Service rollout

    REST URL:
    `https://servicemanagement.googleapis.com/v1/services/{service-name}/rollouts/{rollout-id}`
    <br /> REST schema is defined
    [here](https://cloud.google.com/service-management/reference/rest/v1/services.rollouts). A
    `Rollout` defines how Google Service Management should deploy service
    configurations to backend systems and how the configurations take effect
    at runtime. It lets service producers specify multiple service
    configuration
    versions to be deployed together, and a strategy that indicates how they
    should be used.

    Updating a managed service's configuration can be dangerous, as a
    configuration error can lead to a service outage. To mitigate risks,
    Service Management
    supports gradual rollout of service configuration changes. This feature
    gives service producers time to identity potential issues and rollback
    service
    configuration changes in case of errors, thus minimizing the customer
    impact of bad configurations. For example, you could specify that 5% of
    traffic uses configuration 1, while the remaining 95% uses configuration
    2.

    Service Management keeps a history of rollouts so that service
    producers can undo to previous configuration versions. You can rollback a
    configuration by initiating a new `Rollout` that clones a previously
    submitted rollout record.
  rules:
  - selector: google.iam.v1.IAMPolicy.GetIamPolicy
    description: |-
      Gets the access control policy for a resource. Returns an empty policy
      if the resource exists and does not have a policy set.

  - selector: google.iam.v1.IAMPolicy.SetIamPolicy
    description: |-
      Sets the access control policy on the specified resource. Replaces
      any existing policy.

      Can return `NOT_FOUND`, `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, and `PERMISSION_DENIED`
      errors.

  - selector: google.iam.v1.IAMPolicy.TestIamPermissions
    description: |-
      Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource. If the
      resource does not exist, this will return an empty set of
      permissions, not a `NOT_FOUND` error.

      Note: This operation is designed to be used for building
      permission-aware UIs and command-line tools, not for authorization
      checking. This operation may "fail open" without warning.

  - selector: google.longrunning.Operations.ListOperations
    description: Lists service operations that match the specified filter in the request.
